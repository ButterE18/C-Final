I haven't started much on this final, but I have a general idea of what I will be working on as time progresses. 
I plan to create an interactive storytelling game that takes advantage of the random numberator operation we covered a while back to create different story lines that the user can go through.
So far, I have the introduction, but I will continue to work on it as time progresses.
